The three biggest information security challenges of 2015

First: Vulnerabilities can turn into intrusion points.  Heartbleed, poodle,
Sandworm and Shellshock are not Hollywood blockbusters. They're systemic
vulnerabilities that cybercriminaâ?<ls took advantage of.

Second: The age of cybercrime syndicates.  Durbin explained that ever since
the birth of the Internet, crime syndicates saw value in exploiting worldwide
connectivity.

Third: Threats on the homefront. According to FCW, the biggest threat to
corporate and private data has nothing to do with technology. In fact, the
source noted that 25 percent of cyberincidents reported 2014 were labeled
"non-cyber," topping the list of data breach causes.
